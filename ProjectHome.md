# OpenCVMFC #
### VS MFC Wrapper for Intel's OpenCV Package ###

## Description ##

As  a part of an person image process project in Computer Vision, I have created a small OpenCV wrapper for VS2008 MFC , so I could use OpenCV from C ++, and create more elaborate user interfaces.


## Release ##

OpenCVMFC-0.1 Released.


## System Requirements ##

> ### + VS 2008 SP1 ###


> ### + OpenCV ###
> > You will need to download and install the OpenCV library from [here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary).
> > You will need to download and install the OpenCV library in order for this to compile. Make sure to install it into C:\Program Files\OpenCV so that the installer will be able to locate them.

## Examples ##



> I have also uploaded a few examples .

Please note that I didn't make any attempt to be compatible with OpenCV API. I preferred to design the wrappers in a way that they will be natural to VS2008 MFC users, so don't be mad if it's not 100% in the spirit of OpenCV.
